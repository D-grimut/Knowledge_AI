What is an Agile Process?
 Driven by customer descriptions of what is 

required (scenarios).
 Customer feedback is frequent and acted on.
 Recognizes that plans are short-lived.
 Develops software iteratively with a heavy 

emphasis on construction activities.
 Delivers multiple ‘software increments’ as 

executable prototypes.
 Adapts as project or technical changes occur.

Agility Principles
 Customer satisfaction is achieved by providing value 

through software that is delivered to the customer as 
rapidly as possible.

 Develop recognizing that requirements will change 
and welcome changes.

 Deliver software increments frequently (weeks not 
months) to stakeholders to ensure feedback on their 
deliveries is meaningful.

 Agile team populated by motivated individuals using 
face-to-face communication to convey information.

 Team process encourages technical excellence, good 
design, simplicity, and avoids unnecessary work.

COMP 354, Fall 2023 Agility and Process 4



Agility Principles 
 Working software that meets customer needs is the 

primary goal.
 Pace and direction of the team’s work must be 

“sustainable,” enabling them to work effectively for 
long periods of time.

 An agile team is a “self-organizing team”- that can 
be trusted to develop well-structured architectures 
that lead to solid designs and customer satisfaction.

 Part of the team culture is to consider its work 
introspectively with the intent of improving how to 
become more effective its primary goal (customer 
satisfaction).
